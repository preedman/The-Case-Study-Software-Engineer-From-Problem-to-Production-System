# Aussie Rentals Business Overview

## What is Aussie Car Rentals?

Aussie Car Rentals is a premier vehicle rental provider operating across the Australian continent. The company is built on a model of high-availability fleet management and customer-centric service.

### The Business Structure

#### Branches and Inventory
Aussie Rentals operates 20 branches located in major towns and cities across Australia. 
*   **Fleet Size:** The company maintains a fleet of 1,000 cars.
*   **Car Groups:** To simplify pricing and allocation, cars are categorized into **Groups** (e.g., Economy, Compact, Luxury, 4WD). Each group has a standard daily rate.
*   **Branch Management:** Each branch is managed by a Branch Manager and staffed by Rental Agents who handle the physical checkout, return, and inventory verification.

#### The Business Process – Reservations and Rentals
Aussie Rentals supports two primary rental paths:
1.  **Advance Reservations:** Customers book a specific car group (and optionally a specific model) for a future date via online or phone channels.
2.  **Walk-in Rentals:** Immediate rentals are accepted at branch counters subject to real-time availability. These are intended for short-term needs and operate under a different pricing structure.

#### The Business Process – Returns and Fleet Distribution
Cars may be returned to any Aussie Rentals branch, regardless of where the rental originated. 
*   **Ownership Transfer:** If a car is returned to a branch other than its starting location, the "receiving" branch assumes ownership of that vehicle. This dynamic distribution requires the system to track car locations in real-time.

#### The Business Process – Maintenance and Servicing
A dedicated Service Department handles vehicle health. 
*   **Service Bookings:** Cars must be scheduled for maintenance based on mileage or time intervals. 
*   **Operational Priority:** A car scheduled for maintenance is flagged as "Unavailable" and cannot be allocated to reservations or walk-in rentals until the service is marked as complete.

#### The Business Process – Customers and Eligibility
Aussie Rentals maintains a comprehensive Customer Profile for every renter.
*   **Rental Limit:** A customer may hold multiple future reservations but is strictly limited to having **one** active rental at any given time.
*   **Risk Management:** The company tracks "Bad Experiences," including late returns, payment defaults, and vehicle damage. 
*   **Refusal of Service:** Serious or repeated negative experiences result in the customer being placed on a **Corporate Blacklist**, which triggers an automatic refusal of any future rental requests.
