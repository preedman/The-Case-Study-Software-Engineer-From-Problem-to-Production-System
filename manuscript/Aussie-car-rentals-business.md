## What is Aussie Car Rentals

Aussie Car Rentals is a car rental company owned by private investors.

### The Business Structure

#### Branches

Aussie Rentals has 20 branches in towns and cities across Australia . At each branch cars, classified by
car group, are available for rental. Each branch has a manager and rental staff agents who
handle rentals and car returns.

#### Rental Cars

Aussie Rentals has 1000 cars available for rental. They are classified by car group which defines the make and model of the car.

#### Car Maintenance

Aussie Rentals has a service department which deals with car maintenance.

### The Business Process – Rental

The rental process involves the following steps:
* Most rentals are by reservation. 
* The rental period and the car group are specified at the time of reservation.
* Aussie Rentals will also accept immediate ("walk-in") rentals, if cars are available.

### The Business Process – Returns

A car return is processed by the branch manager or rental staff agent.

Cars rented from one branch of Aussie Rentals may be returned to a different branch. The
renting branch must ensure that the car has been returned to some branch at the end of
the rental period. If a car is returned to a branch other than the one that rented it,
ownership of the car is assigned to the new branch.

### The Business Process – Servicing

Aussie Rentals has a service department which deals with car maintenance.

Cars may be booked for maintenance at any time provided that the service department has capacity on the day in
question. 
Only one booking per car per day is allowed. A rental or service may cover several days.

### The Business Process – Customers

A customer can have several reservations but only one car rented at a time. Aussie Rentals
keeps records of customers, their rentals and bad experiences such as late return,
problems with payment and damage to cars. 

This information is used to decide whether to approve a rental.
