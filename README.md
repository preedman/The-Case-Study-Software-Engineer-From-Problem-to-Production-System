# The Case Study Software Engineer: From Problem to Production System

This repository contains the documentation and manuscript materials for **"The Case Study Software Engineer"**, a guide focused on the end-to-end development of a production-grade software system.

## 📖 The Case Study: Aussie Rentals

The core of this project is anchored by **Aussie Rentals**, a fictional car rental company. 

### Project Origin
This case study is adapted from the widely recognized **EU-Rentals** car rental model, which is a staple in software engineering literature (specifically in the context of Model-Driven Architecture and Business Rules). By shifting the context to "Aussie Rentals," we explore:
*   **Business Processes:** From booking and vehicle allocation to fleet maintenance.
*   **Business Rules:** Complex constraints involving driver eligibility, blacklisting, and loyalty-based upgrades.
*   **System Evolution:** Taking raw requirements and transforming them into structured logic and, eventually, a production system.

## 📁 Repository Structure

*   `/manuscript`: Contains the draft chapters of the book.
    *   `Chapter1-Aussie-car-rentals-business.md`: High-level business overview and organizational structure.
    *   `chapter2-Aussire-Rentals-Business-Rules.md`: Detailed constraints and car allocation algorithms.
*   `/resources`: Supplemental files and assets used in the case study.
*   `Book.txt`: A tracking file for manuscript progress.

## 🚀 Objective

The goal of this material is to provide a practical roadmap for software engineers to understand how business requirements are captured, refined, and implemented using modern software engineering principles.
